          <h2>North Wales Crusaders </h2>
          <p>North Wales Crusaders (Welsh: Croesgadwyr Gogledd Cymru Rygbi'r Gynghrair) are a professional rugby league club based in Wrexham, Wales. 
            They are the successors to the former Super League club Crusaders Rugby League. From 2015, North Wales Crusaders will compete in the re-structured Kingstone Press League 1,
            the third tier of European rugby league (behind the Super League and Kingstone Press Championship). They play their home games at the Racecourse Ground</p>

            <h2><span class="text-muted">Celtic Warriors</span></h2>
            <p>In the summer of 2003, the WRU voted to reduce the top tier of Welsh professional rugby union from nine clubs into five regions. 
            The Celtic Warriors officially represented the Mid-Glamorgan Valleys area, which in practice meant that they were a combination of Pontypridd RFC and Bridgend RFC.
            Financial problems at Pontypridd RFC led to the sale of their half of the Warriors to Bridgend RFC owner Leighton Samuel, 
            which he gifted to the WRU. He then later sold his half to the WRU who in the summer of 2004 decided to liquidate the club.</p>

            <h2><span class="text-muted">Celtic Crusaders</span></h2>
            <p>Leighton Samuel was approached by the RFL to form a rugby league club and join the professional ranks. 
            The new Celtic Crusaders were argued to be a continuation of the old Celtic Warriors side and were based at Bridgend's Brewery Field.
            In 2009, the team were awarded a Super League licence and played one season in Super League before financial problems saw the club renamed
            Crusaders Rugby League and moved to Wrexham. The club created an academy side for players based in North Wales known as North Wales Crusaders. 
            After two seasons at Wrexham, the club pulled out from bidding for a 2012 Super League licence.</p>

            <h2><span class="text-muted">North Wales Crusaders</span></h2>
            The club was founded in 2011 following the folding of Crusaders Rugby League. 
            They officially joined Championship 1, the third tier of rugby league in the United Kingdom, on 11 October 2011. 
            Their name, which continues the Crusaders branding, was selected in a fan contest.[1][2] A rival bid from Wrexham-based Glyndwr Chargers was withdrawn.
            The club held open trials for any new players to attend.
            North Wales Crusaders won their first game, a friendly, 34–12 away to Leigh East.

            <h2><span class="text-muted">Symbol</span></h2>
            <p>First logo used by the North Wales Crusaders
            The club have revealed a logo ready for use in the 2012 season which an evolution of the 2011 logo. 
            The badge, inspired by the Prince of Wales's feathers, has three white feathers adorning the centre of a disc with the Flag of St David on. 
            To the left and right of the feathers, the words "North" and "Wales" appear on the disc as opposed to "Rugby" and "League" on the old logo. 
            Beneath the feathers remains "Crusaders".</p>
